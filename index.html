    <h2 id="part-1">Beginnings and Early Years</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Baseball has been around since the mid 1800s. It grew to become of on America's most popular sports. But how did this happen? Let's look at a few key dates.</p>
    <h3>Key Dates:</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>1869 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Amateur leagues had already been formed across the country, but this was the year MLB credits the founding of professional baseball.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed in Cincinnati, Ohio.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
           <li>
                1876
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The National League (NL) was formed in this year. It was the first professional baseball league in the United States.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first NL game was played in this year. It was between the Boston Red Stockings and the Chicago White Stockings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clubs began to have more power than the players. They could enforce player contracts and set player salaries. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                1892
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The American League was formed in this year. It was the second professional baseball league in the United States.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                1903
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The two leagues, the National League and the American League, merged to form the American League Baseball (MLB).
                    </li>
                </ul>
           </li>

        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2 id="part-2">The Dead Ball Era (1900-1919)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The Dead Ball Era was a period in baseball history where the game was dominated by defense and pitching. This era was characterized by low run totals and a focus on bunting and base running.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        This interactive dashboard could prove useful in understanding the Dead Ball Era. It shows the number of runs scored per game over time, which can help us understand the impact of the era on the game.
    </p>
    <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1765404465721' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='MLB ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Vi&#47;VisualHistoryoftheMLB&#47;MLB&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='VisualHistoryoftheMLB&#47;MLB' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Vi&#47;VisualHistoryoftheMLB&#47;MLB&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1765404465721');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='1330px';vizElement.style.height='1027px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
    <p>
        As we can see in this dashboard, the number of runs scored per game was significantly lower during the Dead Ball Era compared to the years before and after. This suggests that the game was more focused on defense and pitching during this period. The low run totals were due to the fact that the ball was not hit as far as it is today, and the game was more about bunting and base running than hitting home runs.
    </p>

    <h2>Babe Ruth (1920-1934)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Babe Ruth was a legendary baseball player who played for the New York Yankees from 1920 to 1934. He is often credited with changing the game of baseball from a defensive and pitching-focused game to a more offensive and home run-focused game. Thus we can see in the dashboard that home runs increased significantly after Babe Ruth's emergence.</p>

    <h2 id="part-3">Breaking the Color Barrier: Jackie Robinson (1947)</h2>
    <p>To understand the significance of breaking the color barrier in baseball, here's a video explaining it.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqa_ztWy40I?si=ZhraU2WNp-lLWQ1P" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p class="paragraph">Breaking the color barrier in baseball was a significant moment in the history of the sport. It marked the end of segregation in professional sports and opened up opportunities for African American players to compete at the highest level.</p>

    <h2 id="part-4">Relocation and Expansion (1950s-1960s)</h2>
    <div class="image-bullets-section">
        <img src="img/giants_dodgers.png" alt="Giants and Dodgers Rivalry Image" class="section-image">
        <ul class="section-bullets">
            <li>This was the time that MLB teams began to move westward. The two most notable ones being the former Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants moving to California.</li>
            <li>These two teams were heated rivals in New York, and when the Dodgers made the decision to relocate to Los Angeles, they convinced the Giants to move to the west coast as well, moving to San Francisco</li>
            <li>I should mention that I am a huge Giants fan, they are my favorite sports team besides BYU Football. This rivalry along with the Yankees/Red Sox rivalry is one of the most famous in baseball history.</li>
            <li>
                This relocation marked the beginning of a new era for the MLB, as it expanded its reach beyond the east coast and into the west coast. It also brought about a new level of competition and excitement to the sport.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="part-5">The Steroid Era and further expansion (1990s-2000s)</h2>
    <p>
        Skipping ahead to the 1990s and 2000s, the MLB faced significant challenges due to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly steroids. This era, often referred to as the "Steroid Era," saw a dramatic increase in home run production and a shift in the game's focus from defense to offense. Furthermore, the league continued to expand, with new teams being added to the league, including the Colorado Rockies (1993), Florida Marlins (1993), Arizona Diamondbacks (1998), and Tampa Bay Rays (1998).
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="part-6">The Modern Game: The Statcast Era (2000s-Present)</h2>
    <div class="statcast-section">
        <div class="statcast-text">
        <p>
            The Statcast Era, which began in the early 2000s, has transformed the way baseball is analyzed and understood. Statcast uses advanced technology to track player performance and game statistics in real-time, providing a wealth of data for analysts, coaches, and fans. This era has also seen the rise of sabermetrics, a statistical approach to analyzing baseball that emphasizes the use of data to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The average time it took to play a game also had increased over this time period to an average of around 3 hours and 15 minutes, which is significantly longer than the average game time in the early days of the league.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, the league introduced the pitch clock, which aims to speed up the game by limiting the amount of time pitchers can take between pitches. This move is part of a broader effort to make the game more exciting and engaging for fans. This has been successful in my opinion, as it has helped to reduce the time between pitches and make the game more dynamic and fast-paced, as well as higher scoring games.

    <h2 id="part-7">The Future of Baseball</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        In my opinion, baseball is at its best right now. While average viewership numbers have been declining in recent years, the game is more fun to watch than ever for me and other hardcore baseball fans. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        There is a lot of potential for expansion right now, with talks of increasing the total amount of teams to 32 from 30. In fact, there are already discussions about potential new teams in cities like Nashville, Tennessee, and Salt Lake City, Utah.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Additionally, the game is constantly evolving, with new technologies and innovations being introduced to enhance the fan experience. For example, the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is becoming more common, allowing fans to experience the game in new and exciting ways.

        Thank you for reading this article. I hope you have enjoyed learning about the history of baseball and the various eras that have shaped the sport. If you have any questions, I have implemented an AI chatbot to answer any additional questions about baseball history. Also feel free to play this small game I made. Try and hit as many home runs as you can! Enjoy!
